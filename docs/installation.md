All of the artifacts below are available for both **JVM and Scala.js**.

Note, that artifacts that use Cats Effect 3 are published under a different version to those published for Cats Effect 2 (minor version bump), because they're binary incompatible.

```scala mdoc:passthrough
import weaver.docs._

import BuildMatrix._

val effectsTable = Table
    .create("Effect types", effects)
    .render(catsEffect3Version, artifactsCE2Version, artifactsCE3Version)

val integrationsTable = Table
    .create("Integrations", integrations)
    .render(catsEffect3Version, artifactsCE2Version, artifactsCE3Version)

println(effectsTable)
println(integrationsTable)
```

Weaver offers effect-type specific test frameworks. The Build setup depends on
the effect-type library you've elected to use (or test against).

Refer yourself to the library specific pages to get the correct configuration.
