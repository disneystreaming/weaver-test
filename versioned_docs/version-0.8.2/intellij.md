Starting with version 0.6.0, weaver provides IntelliJ integration by means of a JUnit runner that IntelliJ picks up automatically.

## Note regarding the previous IntelliJ integration

We (the maintainers) had tried to build an IntelliJ plugin. It worked but its maintenance became problematic quickly for us. We have made the decision to deprecate that plugin, sacrificing a little bit of UX in favour of an approach that is more compatible with our time constraints.

## Installation

Ensure the JUnit plugin is enabled in IntelliJ. Nothing else is needed (as long as weaver is declared correctly in your build).

## Usage

### Running suites

When test suites are open in IntelliJ, buttons appear to the left of the editor (next to the line number of the suite declaration), letting you run individual suites from the IDE.

### Ignorning individual tests

An `.ignore` extension method is provided on strings, and can be used when declaring tests. All tests that are tagged with `.ignore` will be ignored in the test suite, including any that are tagged with `.only`.

```scala Â 
import weaver._
import cats.effect._

object MyIgnoreSuite extends SimpleIOSuite {

  test("test this") {
    IO(success)
  }

  test("do not test this".ignore) {
    IO.raiseError(new Throwable("Boom"))
  }

}
```

### Running individual tests

A `.only` extension method is provided on strings, and can be used when declaring tests. When at least one test is "tagged" as such in a suite, weaver will ignore all tests but the ones that have the "only" tag. Note: `.ignore` has precedence over `.only`.

```scala
import weaver._
import cats.effect._

object MyOnlySuite extends SimpleIOSuite {

  test("test this".only) {
    IO(success)
  }

  test("do not test this") {
    IO.raiseError(new Throwable("Boom"))
  }

}
```

### Note regarding test durations

Because of inherently modelling incompatibilities between weaver and IntelliJ, we had to implement the JUnit runner in a way that makes it impossible for durations to be reported correctly by the IDE. We apologise for the inconvenience.
